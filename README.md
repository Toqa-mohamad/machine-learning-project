Weather Temperature Prediction using Linear Regression

Project Overview:
This project aims to predict temperature values based on weather-related
features using Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression
techniques. The project demonstrates the full data analysis pipeline
starting from data exploration to model evaluation.

Problem Statement:
Weather forecasting plays a crucial role in many real-world applications
such as agriculture, transportation, and climate analysis. The main
objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between
temperature and other weather variables, build regression models, and
compare their performance.

Dataset Description:
The dataset contains daily weather measurements.
Main features include: - MinTemp: Minimum temperature - MaxTemp: Maximum
temperature - Humidity: Humidity percentage - WindSpeed: Wind speed -
Pressure: Atmospheric pressure - Temperature: Target variable

Algorithms Used:
1.	Simple Linear Regression
2.	Multiple Linear Regression

Implementation Steps:
1.	Load dataset
2.	Preprocess data
3.	Train regression models
4.	Evaluate performance
5.	Compare results

Results:
Multiple Linear Regression outperformed Simple Linear Regression in
terms of accuracy and error metrics.

Libraries Used:
⦁	Python
⦁	NumPy
⦁	Pandas
⦁	Matplotlib
⦁	Scikit-learn

 Conclusion:
Regression techniques are effective for predicting temperature when
relevant weather features are used.
